- oracle input from our calendar: the guest chooses his time period to share his room token and then for that time period the room token is not available to him but to us ("the resort"). we then forward the temporary permission to use to token to another guest (to his eth wallet if he is a crypto customer or we put it on a hardware wallet and give it to him at the arrival to the resort or we just keep it for ourselves if he doesn't care and is not coming 100% anonymously )

-after the renting period is over the room token is returned automatically

- monthly payout in utility tokens to the token holder depending on if the Room was rented

- a fixed amount of utility tokens reward is sent to a special wallet for charity

4) zkSnark password to prove that you own the room token on your wallet at the arrival to the resort

5) biometrics on eth wallet for door unlock (you don't need a pass anymore, you prove token ownership with a fingerprint)
